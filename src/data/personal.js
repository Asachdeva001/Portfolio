  extendedBio: `I'm a Computer Science student at Punjab Engineering College (PEC), passionate about building impactful digital solutions. My journey in web development started with a curiosity about how websites work, and it has evolved into a deep passion for creating elegant, high-performance applications.

I specialize in full-stack web development with hands-on experience in modern technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. I'm particularly interested in building scalable applications that solve real-world problems and provide exceptional user experiences.

Beyond coding, I'm fascinated by the intersection of design and development. I believe that great software is not just about functionality—it's about creating intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing experiences that users love.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or learning about cloud infrastructure and DevOps practices. I'm always eager to collaborate on interesting projects and connect with fellow developers.`,
